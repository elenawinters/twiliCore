# TwiliCore

TwiliCore is a small resource for FiveM/RedM that handles logic that one or more scripts depend on. Instead of putting the logic into each script independently, it is easier for it to be available to any script that needs it.

## Current Capabilties

- Advanced Damage Calculation (`Five/RedM`)

## Compatibility

I try to make sure that everything works on both FiveM and RedM.
